# Top100_Movies
Webscraping with Beautiful Soup to create a .txt file of Empire's top 100 Movies. Perfect for the next time you need to find a good movie and you can cross it off the list so you can remember which ones you have watched!

Featuring: List comprehension (my weakness) :) I started to write many lines of code with a for loop but stopped myself and forced myself to conquer list comprehension.. we are getting there!
